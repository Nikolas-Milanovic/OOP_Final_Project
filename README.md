# Settlers-of-Catan

This was my OOP programing course's final project, where we received a 96%. It's based on the board game Settlers of Catan, except with a few adjustments to fit the University of Waterloo theme. 

For this project I worked in a group of 3 where we used Git to manage our workflow. 

The project was very OOP intensive, we planned ahead using a UML diagram (link below) where we implemented an **observer design pattern**

Additionally, we created an extensive design plan (link below)
