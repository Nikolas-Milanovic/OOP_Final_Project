# Settlers-of-Catan

To play the game on a Mac or Linux computer:
* Dowload the 'Catan_Executable_(Mac|Linux)' folder 
* In terminal navigate to the 'Catan_Executable_(Mac|Linux)' folder location
* Run the following command:  **./constructor**
* If you see ./constructor: Permission denied, Run: chmod u+x ./constructor

Note: Unfortunetly due to this being a common project used for this course I'm unable to share the source code.


This was my OOP programing course's final project, where we received a 96%. It's based on the board game Settlers of Catan, except with a few adjustments to fit the University of Waterloo theme. The project is built with C++ and is played via the command line, example:

For this project I worked in a group of 3 where we used Git to manage our workflow. 

The project was very OOP intensive, we planned ahead using a UML diagram (screenshot) where we implemented an **observer design pattern**

Additionally, we created an extensive design plan (please see pdf linked below)

Key C++ design principals used:
* Classes
* Inheritance 
* Exception Handlings 
* References & Pointers 
* Smart Pointers 
* Input & Output Streams
